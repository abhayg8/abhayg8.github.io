    <div id="AboutMe">
        <h2 class="sectionheading">About Me</h2>
        <p class="abouttext">I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Toronto. During my degree I focused on software and computer hardware.
            In the coming months, I will return to Qualcomm where I did my last internship to work as a Software Engineer in the Autmotive
            Division.<br><br>

            I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects through internships, coursework as well as my own interests. 
            Largely, I have worked on projects involving embedded systems or systems software. From these experiences, 
            I have honed my programming skills in C/C++, Java, Python and Verilog. <br><br>

            In my spare time I love to play the guitar and make music. I'm also an avid follower of sport (soccer and F1) and am always 
            trying to improve my lap times on my sim racing rig.

                Caracal is a <span class="pane-highlight">deterministic distributed database</span> written in <span class="pane-highlight">C++</span> 
                . It was created as part of a research project by Prof.Asvhin Goel and his graduate students. 
                I worked on with 3 others for my final year design project. Prior to our work, Caracal used static data partitions. 
                When there is <span class="pane-highlight">imbalanced load</span>, performance is affected. 
                In our project we implemented <span class="pane-highlight">data migration</span> 
                between nodes to address this gap. In the benchmarking for Caracal, transactions were all generated prior to
                execution on all nodes. This is not a good approximation of <span class="pane-highlight">real-world use cases</span>
                . Therefore, we also implemented 
                <span class="pane-highlight">dynamic transaction generation</span> that would allow the generation of skewed loads such 
                that data migration could be tested using the TPCC benchmark. We have also implemented the foundations for 
                <span class="pane-highlight">migration policy</span> so that peformance gains can be realised.</p>

                We implemented a client that can send requests (GET, PUT etc.) and a <span class="pane-highlight">distributed service</span>

                The servers are organised into a <span class="pane-highlight">ring using consistent hashing</span>
                to ensure balanced load. We also implemented <span class="pane-highlight">data replication</span>

                and to add/remove them, we implemented an <span class="pane-highlight">external configuration service</span> 
                that tracks the system state. 
                Data is <span class="pane-highlight">persisted to disk</span> to allow for recovery if the system restarts
